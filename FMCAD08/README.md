# FMCAD'08 Benchmarks

Lustre benchmarks mentioned in:

George Hagen and Cesare Tinelli. Scaling up the formal verification of Lustre programs with SMT-based techniques. In Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Formal Methods in Computer-Aided Design (FMCAD'08), Portland, Oregon. IEEE, 2008.

Classified according to the type of the streams used in the models. Duplicates have been removed. Misplaced parentheses were detected in some of the benchmarks and fixed.

The Lustre models in the `Int32` and `Real_Int32` directories, not included in the original set, were generated from the models in the `Int` and `Real_Int` directories by replacing mathematical integer type `int` by finite precision integer `int32`.
